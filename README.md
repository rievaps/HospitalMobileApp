# HospitalMobileApp
Mobile Application for Hospital

This mobile application was developed by me and my team of 5 using Android Studio with the implementation of CRUD. This project aims to make it easier for users to get information about health, get various information in the hospital, and make it easier for users to be able to consult with doctors. The research objectives of designing the My New Life application are as follows:
1. Designing and creating mobile-based applications so that users can get services more easily, quickly and safely.
2. Make it easy for users who want to find information or buy medicine without having to go to the hospital based on the type of drug and the desired dosage.
3. Designing and creating mobile-based applications so that users can get medicine more easily, quickly and safely.
